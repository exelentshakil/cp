# 🚀 My Competitive Programming Journey on Codeforces

Welcome to my **competitive programming journey**! 🎯 This repository tracks the problems I’ve solved on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) to improve my **problem-solving skills** and **algorithmic thinking**. 

I’m focusing on mastering:
- **GCD & LCM** for synchronization and divisibility problems.
- **Modular Arithmetic** to handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Combinatorics** for counting and arrangement problems.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** for optimization with overlapping subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms** to solve problems step-by-step with local optimization.
- **Graph Theory** for pathfinding and connectivity problems.
- **Backtracking and Divide & Conquer** to explore possibilities and break problems down.

## 📈 Goal

To become proficient at **competitive programming** by consistently solving problems on **Codeforces** and other platforms.

## 🔥 Problem-Solving Strategies

### 1. **Greedy Algorithm Example:** [Coin Change Problem](./Problems/Greedy/CoinChange.cpp)
   - Use a **greedy strategy** when making the locally optimal choice leads to the global solution.

### 2. **Dynamic Programming Example:** [Climbing Stairs](./Problems/DP/ClimbingStairs.cpp)
   - Use **DP** when problems have **overlapping subproblems** and you need to reuse previous results.

### 3. **Graph Theory Example:** [Shortest Path with Floyd-Warshall](./Problems/Graphs/FloydWarshall.cpp)
   - **Graph algorithms** are great for **pathfinding** and **network problems**.

## 🧰 Useful Templates

- **Basic Boilerplate Template:**
  ```cpp
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;

  typedef long long ll;
  typedef pair<int, int> pii;
  typedef vector<int> vi;
  #define fastio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(NULL);cout.tie(NULL);

  const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
  const int INF = INT_MAX;

  int main() {
      fastio;
      // Solution code here
      return 0;
  }
